I am a professor at the [Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México (UAEMéx)](https://www.uaemex.mx/), a senior consultant at [Scientificomm](https://scientificomm.info/), and a Level 2 member of [Mexico’s National System of Researchers (SNI), Conacyt](https://conacyt.mx/). With over 20 years of experience, my work focuses on **scholarly communication, Open Science, and Open Access**. My academic background includes Sociology, Urban Studies, Social Theory, Education, and Data Science and Analytics.

Throughout my career, I have worked internationally as a visiting professor in Research Methodology at the [University of Cuenca, Ecuador](https://www.ucuenca.edu.ec/) and as a visiting researcher at the [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)](https://www.unam.mx/). Since 2018, I have been an [Ambassador for Latin America for Figshare](https://figshare.com/), promoting open-access initiatives. I also mentor researchers through [Rising Scholars](https://risingscholars.net/en/) (formerly AuthorAID), supporting early-career scholars in low- and middle-income countries.

I actively contribute to the development of **Open Science policies**. I played a key role in the creation of [Mexico’s 2014 Open Access Law](https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5345503&fecha=20/05/2014&print=true). Currently, I serve on the [Board of Directors for the Open Education Conference](https://openeducationconference.org/about/board), am part of the [Advisory Group for the OA Switchboard](https://www.oaswitchboard.org/governance), and contribute to the [Programme Committee for the Born-Digital Collections Archives and Memory Conference](https://www.sas.ac.uk/about-us/institutes-centres/digital-humanities-research-hub/events/born-digital-collections-archives-memory).

I chair the [Red Iberoamericana de Investigación sobre Globalización y Territorio (RII)](https://seminariorii.uaemex.mx/) and am a member of the [Scientific Committee of the Red Latinoamericana de Sistemas Sociales y Complejidad (RELASSC)](https://www.even3.com.br/relassc2024/).

I believe research should be openly accessible to maximize its societal impact. My work is dedicated to fostering transparency, collaboration, and innovation in academic publishing and scholarly communication.

In 2025, I was recognized as one of the **PREreview Champions**, a distinction that acknowledges a commitment to open, collaborative, and inclusive peer review.
