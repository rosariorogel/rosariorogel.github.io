I am a professor at the <a href="https://www.uaemex.mx/" target="_blank">Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México (UAEMéx)</a>, a senior consultant at <a href="https://scientificomm.info/" target="_blank">Scientificomm</a>, and a Level 2 member of <a href="https://conacyt.mx/" target="_blank">Mexico’s National System of Researchers (SNI), Conacyt</a>. With over 20 years of experience, my work focuses on <strong>scholarly communication, Open Science, and Open Access</strong>. My academic background includes Sociology, Urban Studies, Social Theory, Education, and Data Science and Analytics.

Throughout my career, I have worked internationally as a visiting professor in Research Methodology at the <a href="https://www.ucuenca.edu.ec/" target="_blank">University of Cuenca, Ecuador</a> and as a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://www.unam.mx/" target="_blank">Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)</a>. Since 2018, I have been an <a href="https://figshare.com/" target="_blank">Ambassador for Latin America for Figshare</a>, promoting open-access initiatives. I also mentor researchers through <a href="https://risingscholars.net/en/" target="_blank">Rising Scholars</a> (formerly AuthorAID), supporting early-career scholars in low- and middle-income countries.

I actively contribute to the development of <strong>Open Science policies</strong>. I played a key role in the creation of <a href="https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5345503&fecha=20/05/2014&print=true" target="_blank">Mexico’s 2014 Open Access Law</a>. Currently, I serve on the <a href="https://openeducationconference.org/about/board" target="_blank">Board of Directors for the Open Education Conference</a>, am part of the <a href="https://www.oaswitchboard.org/governance" target="_blank">Advisory Group for the OA Switchboard</a>, and contribute to the <a href="https://www.sas.ac.uk/about-us/institutes-centres/digital-humanities-research-hub/events/born-digital-collections-archives-memory" target="_blank">Programme Committee for the Born-Digital Collections Archives and Memory Conference</a>.

I chair the <a href="https://seminariorii.uaemex.mx/" target="_blank">Red Iberoamericana de Investigación sobre Globalización y Territorio (RII)</a> and am a member of the <a href="https://www.even3.com.br/relassc2024/" target="_blank">Scientific Committee of the Red Latinoamericana de Sistemas Sociales y Complejidad (RELASSC)</a>.

I believe research should be openly accessible to maximize its societal impact. My work is dedicated to fostering transparency, collaboration, and innovation in academic publishing and scholarly communication.

In 2025, I was recognized as one of the <strong>PREreview Champions</strong>, a distinction that acknowledges a commitment to open, collaborative, and inclusive peer review.
